# DecoderGame

Welcome to the DecoderGame! (working title)

This game is all about decoding the path given to you in order to find your way to the next level. In order to do this you must use logic and reason as well as guessing to decode a string of emojis. The emojis represent the four directions: north,west,east,and south. 
The player starts at the 1st through 3rd tile in the path. 
Use the arrow keys to move in the direction of choice.

BROWN TILES:
    Represent the path.
RED TILES:
    Represent an error tile.
    Uncovering an error tile will result in one less error.
GREEN TILES:
    Represent the starting tile.
YELLOW TILES:
    Represent the end tile.
    When you move onto a yellow tile you move onto the next level and the dimensions of the map increase.
